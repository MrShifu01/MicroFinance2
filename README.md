# Web App Plan: Cash Loans Management System

## System Architecture

The Cash Loans Management System will be developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, along with additional libraries and tools to fulfill the specified requirements.

Choice of Architecture:
The choice of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for the Cash Loans Management System is motivated by several factors. 

1. **Full-stack JavaScript**: The MERN stack allows for a seamless development experience by using JavaScript as the primary language across the entire application stack. This ensures consistency, code reuse, and easier collaboration between front-end and back-end.

2. **Scalability and Performance**: MongoDB, as a NoSQL database, offers high scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for managing large amounts of client and loan data. Express.js and Node.js provide a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, enabling the system to handle concurrent requests efficiently and deliver optimal performance.

3. **Rich UI and Interactivity**: React.js is a powerful front-end library known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM. It enables the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces, which is essential for providing a smooth and intuitive experience in the Cash Loans Management System.

### Deployment Strategy:
The application will be deployed using a cloud platform like Vercel and/or Render. They provide easy deployment and scalability, allowing the application to be accessible to users over the internet. By using a cloud platform, the deployment process is streamlined, and the application can handle a potentially large number of concurrent users.

### Front-end Framework and Styling:
For the front-end development, Create React App (CRA) will be used. CRA is a popular toolchain that sets up a React.js project with a pre-configured build process, development server, and optimized production build. It allows to quickly bootstrap the project without worrying about complex configuration details.

The application will utilize Material-UI, a widely adopted UI component library, for styling and UI components. Material-UI offers a rich set of pre-built components that follow the Material Design guidelines, resulting in a professional and consistent visual experience. The choice of Material-UI simplifies styling and ensures a modern and responsive design for the Cash Loans Management System.

Tailwind CSS will also be used for custom CSS styling. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach, allowing for rapid development and easy customization. It offers a comprehensive set of utility classes that can be used to style components, providing flexibility and maintainability in styling the application.

Overall, the choice of Create React App, Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS for front-end development ensures a smooth development experience, a visually appealing and responsive user interface, and efficient styling capabilities in line with the requirements of the Cash Loans Management System.

### Key Features

1. **Client Management**:
   - View all clients and their relevant details in a table.
   - Expand a client row to view their specific loans in an expanded slot.
   - Filter table data based on various criteria.
   - Search for clients using the search function.
   - Create new clients using a modal popup.
   - Edit client details using a modal popup.
   - Delete clients from the client profile page.

2. **Authentication and User Management**:
   - Support three methods of login/sign-in: Facebook, Google, and password-based login.
   - Use Clerk for authentication and user management.
   - Allow user registration with admin assignment.
   - Admin user can update browser data from the MongoDB, save to local storage, or delete from local storage.
   - Admin user can change user details and access other admin-specific features.

3. **Data Import and Export**:
   - Ability to load a CSV file with appropriate column and data to populate the MongoDB and display it on the frontend.

## Five user stories for the Cash Loans Management System:

1. As an admin user, I want to be able to view a table of all clients with their relevant details, so that I can have a comprehensive overview of the client base.

2. As an admin user, I want to be able to create a new client by filling out a form in a modal popup, so that I can add new clients to the system easily.

3. As an admin user, I want to be able to edit the details of a client by opening a modal popup with pre-filled form fields, so that I can update client information accurately.

4. As an admin user, I want to be able to delete a client from the system, either directly from the main table or from the client profile page, so that I can remove irrelevant or duplicate client records.

5. As a non-admin user, I want to be able to view the main table of clients and their details, as well as the loans table and client profiles, so that I can access relevant information and track loan details for specific clients.
